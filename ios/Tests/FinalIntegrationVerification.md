# Final Integration Verification - Single-User Mode First Implementation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive verification that the complete single-user mode first implementation works correctly across all user scenarios, authentication states, and edge cases.

## âœ… Implementation Summary

### Core Achievement
âœ… **Single-user modes work without authentication while multiplayer properly requests authentication when needed**
