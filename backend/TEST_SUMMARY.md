- WebSocket timeout test has timing issue (minor)

### Coverage Areas
- Overall test coverage: 40.17% (below 80% threshold)
- Need additional integration between services
- Some edge cases in game logic need coverage

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix mock configurations in user service tests
2. Export missing functions from game handler
3. Increase test coverage for game logic
4. Add more integration test scenarios

### Future Improvements
1. Implement property-based testing for ELO calculations
2. Add chaos engineering tests
3. Expand security penetration testing
4. Add performance regression testing
