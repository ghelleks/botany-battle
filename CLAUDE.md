# General Guidance

   * @project-requirements.md is the canonical set of requirements for this project. All work product and documentation must comply with these instructions. When they are in conflict, make that clear.
   * @TODO.md is the project plan. There, we mark what is complete (marked with a ✅), what is in process (marked with a ⌛️), and what is yet to be done.
   * @README.md provides a developer-focused orientation. It is there to help users get started with the project. It does not contain project status, which belongs in @TODO.md.
